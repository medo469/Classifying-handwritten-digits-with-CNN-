# MNIST Handwritten Digits Classification Project

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates a complete machine learning pipeline for classifying handwritten digits using the MNIST dataset. We compare traditional ML approaches (Logistic Regression) with deep learning methods (Convolutional Neural Networks).

## Objectives
1. **Data Loading & Preprocessing**: Load MNIST dataset and normalize pixel values
2. **Baseline Model**: Train a Logistic Regression model as our baseline
3. **Deep Learning Model**: Build and train a CNN for improved performance
4. **Model Comparison**: Evaluate and compare both approaches
5. **Ethics & Reflection**: Discuss AI model limitations and deployment considerations

## Dataset Information
- **Source**: MNIST (Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology)
- **Size**: 70,000 images (60,000 training + 10,000 testing)
- **Image Format**: 28x28 pixels, grayscale
- **Classes**: 10 digits (0-9)
- **Built-in**: Available directly through TensorFlow/Keras

## Requirements
### Required Libraries
```bash
pip install tensorflow>=2.8.0
pip install scikit-learn>=1.0.0
pip install matplotlib>=3.5.0

```

##  How to Run the Project

### Option 1: Jupyter Notebook (Recommended)
1. **Install Jupyter** (if not already installed):
   ```bash
   pip install jupyter
   ```

2. **Launch Jupyter Notebook**:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

3. **Open the notebook**: Navigate to `ai_ml_assignment.ipynb` in the Jupyter interface

4. **Run all cells**: Go to `Cell` → `Run All` or run cells individually with `Shift + Enter`

### Option 2: JupyterLab
1. **Install JupyterLab**:
   ```bash
   pip install jupyterlab
   ```

2. **Launch JupyterLab**:
   ```bash
   jupyter lab
   ```

3. **Open and run** the `ai_ml_assignment.ipynb` file

### Option 3: Google Colab (Cloud-based)
1. Upload `ai_ml_assignment.ipynb` to Google Colab
2. All required libraries are pre-installed in Colab
3. Run cells directly in the cloud environment

- Best practices for responsible AI development

##  Expected Results
- **Logistic Regression**: ~92-95% accuracy
- **CNN**: ~98-99% accuracy
- **Improvement**: ~3-7 percentage points

##  Runtime Expectations
- **Data loading**: 1-2 minutes
- **Logistic Regression training**: 2-3 minutes
- **CNN training**: 10-15 minutes (depending on hardware)
- **Total runtime**: ~20-25 minutes

##  System Requirements
- **Minimum RAM**: 4GB (8GB recommended)
- **Python**: 3.7 or higher
- **GPU**: Optional but recommended for faster CNN training
- **Disk Space**: ~500MB for datasets and dependencies

##  Troubleshooting

### Common Issues & Solutions

1. **TensorFlow Installation Issues**:
   ```bash
   # Try installing specific version
   pip install tensorflow==2.12.0
   ```

2. **Memory Issues**:
   - Reduce batch size in CNN training
   - Use sample_size parameter in Logistic Regression section

3. **Slow Training**:
   - Reduce number of epochs for CNN
   - Use smaller sample size for initial testing

4. **Import Errors**:
   ```bash
   # Ensure all packages are installed
   pip install --upgrade pip
   pip install -r requirements.txt  # if you create one
   ```
